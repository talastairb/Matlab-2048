====================
This is our final project for ENGR131

Known issues:
Numbers spawn when there are invalid moves-minor issue
Save/Load functions freeze the program-major issue
There is no game over notification


Requirements:
Matlab event-driven GUI (implemented; functions)
A function that receives at least one argument (implemented; functions)
Either an array of cells or an array of structs (implemented; functions)
A data file that is read using either ?fscanf? or ?textscan? and modified by the program and rewritten using ?fprintf?. (implemented; does not function)

Dev Phases:
     Proposal-Done

     Alpha-Done
     Overall program: The GUI should run without errors, but the controls do not need to do anything.
     Loop: The header and ?end? should be in the correct place, but the loop does not need to run or contain anything in the body.
     Function: There should be a function header and a function call, but the function does not need to contain anything.
     Cell/struct array: The array should have some data in it, but you don?t have to use it. The data can be ?hardcoded? with temporary values.
     Data file: The file should have some data in it, but you don?t have to use it. The data can be ?hardcoded? with temporary values.

TO FINISH     Beta
     Overall program: Should run without errors. At least one control should do something.
     The loop should do something, even if it doesn?t work correctly.
     Function: The function should be called and do something, even if it doesn?t work correctly.
     Cell/struct array: The array should be used in some way by using the values in it.
TO FIX     Data file: Should be reading and writing the file but don?t have to use the values yet.

TODO     Final
     Overall program: Should run without errors. All controls should work.
     Loop: Should work correctly.
     Function: Should be called and work correctly.
     Cell/struct array: Should be used correctly.
TODO     Data file: Should be reading (using) and writing (changing) the values in it.
