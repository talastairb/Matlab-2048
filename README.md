Instructions:
WASD for up left down right
Q to quit
N for new game
save button saves game to save.txt
load button loads game from save.txt
Play like regular 2048

Assignment Requirements:
     Matlab event-driven GUI
     A function that receives at least one argument
     Either an array of cells or an array of structs
     A data file that is read using either fscanf or textscan and modified by the program and rewritten using fprintf

Dev Phases:
     Proposal-Done

     Alpha-Done
     Overall program: The GUI should run without errors, but the controls do not need to do anything.
     Loop: The header and ?end? should be in the correct place, but the loop does not need to run or contain anything in the body.
     Function: There should be a function header and a function call, but the function does not need to contain anything.
     Cell/struct array: The array should have some data in it, but you don?t have to use it. The data can be hardcoded with temporary values.
     Data file: The file should have some data in it, but you don?t have to use it. The data can be hardcoded with temporary values.

     Beta-Done
     Overall program: Should run without errors. At least one control should do something.
     The loop should do something, even if it doesn?t work correctly.
     Function: The function should be called and do something, even if it doesn?t work correctly.
     Cell/struct array: The array should be used in some way by using the values in it.
     Data file: Should be reading and writing the file but don?t have to use the values yet.

     Final-Done
     Overall program: Should run without errors. All controls should work.
     Loop: Should work correctly.
     Function: Should be called and work correctly.
     Cell/struct array: Should be used correctly.
     Data file: Should be reading (using) and writing (changing) the values in it.
